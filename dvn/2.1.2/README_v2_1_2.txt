DVN 2.1.2, released Oct 9 2010

New in version 2.1.2:

    * Added ability to configure LOCKSS for the Dataverse Network 
      or for an individual dataverse

    * Allow LOCKKS servers to download restricted files, when 
      given permission

    * Added ability for Network Admin to set various requirements 
      for the creation and releasing of dataverses 

    * Allow users to embed thier dataverse into an Open Scholar 
      website (configuration needs to be done at both sites, but 
      allows the customization to be only defined once)

    * For a study, allow users to enter a single geographic 
      coordinate pair, rather than define a bounding box

    * Miscellaneous bug fixes

    * Code cleanup for easier maintainability
