Welcome to the DVN app version 2.2.5

If this is a new install of the DVN:

Note that as of version 2.2.4 we provide a new, automated installer that
takes care of most of the installation and configuration
process. Please consult the new Installers Guide at
http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/thedatanew_guides/book/installers-guides.
The installer package can be found here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvn/files/dvn/2.2.5/dvninstall_v2_2_5.zip.

(Please note that the referenceData*.sql and config_*.zip archive are
no longer provided as standalone files; it is all part of the single
installer package now)
 
As always, if you have any questions and/or run into problems, please
contact us at dvn_support@help.hmdc.harvard.edu.

If you are upgrading an existing DVN v. 2.2.4 installation:

There is no database update script for this release; so all you need
to do is download and deploy the EAR file (DVN-EAR_v2_2_5.ear).

(And if you are upgrading from a version of the DVN *earlier* than 2.2.4, 
please also consult the README files for *all* the versions in between!)
